# motion-activated-surveillance-camera-using-raspberry-pi-with-push-notification-


components used:
     Raspberry pi 2 ,  PIR sensor , picamera ,sd card, power source , LAN cable (you can also use wifi dongle instead) and an app named pushetta(where you will get notification).

working: 
you can put this whole setup where you want to have security. 
so when someone passes through this sensor it senses its motion
and in return it triggers this camera which captures image and record video untill motion exist...at the same time this setup also sends a push notification on your phone with date time and message.
best thing is you can also use multiple phones to get same notification on respective phones.
